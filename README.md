# PRODUCT CLUSTER ANALYSIS

## Introduction
In today's competitive landscape, understanding customer behavior and optimizing inventory are critical. Product clustering offers a data-driven approach to segmenting products, enabling strategic decision-making and operational efficiency

## Overview
This project is aimed at conducting product clustering analysis using historical sales data. The primary objective is to group similar products based on sales patterns.
The dataset includes various features , and these features are described below :
|Sr.no|Features name|Description |
 |-|-|-|
|1)|YEAR| Calendar Year|
|2)|MONTH|Month|
|3)|SUPPLIER|Supplier Name|
|4)|ITEM CODE|Item code|
|5)|ITEM DESCRIPTION|Item Description|
|6)|ITEM TYPE|Item Type|
|7)|RETAIL SALES|Cases of product sold from DLC dispensaries|
|8)|RETAIL TRANSFERS|Cases of product transferred to DLC dispensaries|
|9)|WAREHOUSE SALES|Cases of product sold to MC licensees|
